__The Mystery*__ _(lyrics)_

We live in years of darkness  
full of violence  
and praise for the past  
uncertainty for tomorrow  
while nature  
screams in despair.

Now is losing power  
and disappears  
sleeping in the arms of sadness  
Knowing  
not to pay attention  
to moments past  
Torturing the collective unconscious  
with ideas  
with no reason for existence.  
But they reason.

When I was a child  
I remember  
thoughts did not torture me at all  
There was nature  
There was light  
and I was a little god.

Look there far off  
Everything is gone  
Again  
with the wind  
And the feast became dust  
And time became long.

Now fear is aiming like a stretched bow  
A reminiscent of your inferiority  
towards the approaching  
unknown.

But still what makes us sad  
springs from joy  
that did not enough breathe  
so that she can last the dive in the deep

Spreading in the wind  
a message made of smoke  
was seen only  by you.

Feels like a stone in your shoe  
that aches as you go through  
deeper and deeper  
in collective memory  
until with you  
all is forgotten  
And only mystery  
is left.

Remember when you were a kid  
Thoughts did not torture you a bit  
Still there was nature  
around  
And you were a little god.
