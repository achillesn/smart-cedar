**The Mystery** _(lyrics)_

We live in years of darkness  
 Full of violence  
 And praise for the past  
 Uncertainty for tomorrow  
 While nature  
 screams in despair.

Now is losing power  
 And disappears  
 Sleeping in the arms of sadness  
 Knowing  
 Not to pay attention  
 To moments past  
 Torturing the collective unconscious  
 With ideas  
 With no reason for existence  
 But they reason.

When I was a child  
 I remember  
 Thoughts did not torture me at all  
 There was nature  
 There was light  
 And I was a little god.

Look there far off  
 Everything is gone  
 Again  
 with the wind  
 And the feast became dust  
 And time became long.

Now fear is aiming like a stretched bow  
 A reminiscent of your inferiority  
 Towards the approaching  
 Unknown.

But still what makes us sad  
 Springs from joy  
 That did not enough breathe  
 so that she can last the dive in the deep

Spreading in the wind  
 A message only seen by you  
 As if it was made of smoke

Like a stone in your shoe  
 That aches as you go through  
 Deeper and deeper  
 In collective memory  
 Until with you  
 All is forgotten

And only mystery  
 Is left.

Remember when you were a kid  
 Thoughts did not torture you a bit  
 Still there was nature  
 Around  
 And you were a little god.
