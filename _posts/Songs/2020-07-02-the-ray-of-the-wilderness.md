**Ray of Wilderness*** _(Lyrics)_

Now days if I could talk about revolution  
I would talk about love  
that asks for nothing  
and goes through everything.

I would talk about coherence of times  
changes that clarify the strength of the ephemeral  
about the world that I carry on my shoulders.

I would talk about the start that’s approaching  
about the end that when it’s near  
it redeems you  
the beginning hiding in each breath.

Now, here on my own  
in the heat of cold  
in the light of darkness  
I whisper to infinity  
the need of Logos  
The world is upside down  
and it is suppressing us  
paying no attention  
to infinity  
that unites us.  
Like the snow freezing our fingertips.  
Like truth becoming cold and  
suppressing us.

Without caring for loves and roses  
for plans and new dreams  
Without songs  
With a secret anxiety  
beginning turns around  
Love becomes a spell  
losing all fights  
and spreading all what is right  
in a lonely place.

Our world is upside down, once more  
and it unites us  
Life is an embrace  
that makes us strong.  
Like vapor warming your fingertips  
It makes us strong  
Like a secret wish.

Without caring about pain and loss  
Without pages long  
and cultural stereotypes.  
With new songs  
when the wish is unveiled  
Starting from the start  
and love becomes a cult  
gaining every single battle  
while knowing to return to  
a hug.
