Ray of Wilderness* _(Lyrics)_

Now days if I could talk about revolution  
I would talk about love  
that asks for nothing  
and goes through everything.

I would talk about coherence of times  
changes that clarify the strength of the ephemeral  
about the world that I carry on my shoulders.

I would talk about the start that’s approaching  
about the end that when it’s near  
it redeems you  
the beginning hiding in each breath.

Now, here on my own  
in the heat of cold  
in the light of darkness  
I whisper to infinity  
the need of Logos

The world is upside down

And it is suppressing us

Paying no attention

To infinity

That unites us.

Like the snow freezing our fingertips

Like truth becoming cold and

Suppressing us.

Without caring for loves and roses

For plans and new dreams

Without songs

With a secret anxiety

Beginning turns around

Love becomes a spell

Losing all fights

And spreading what is right

in a lonely place.

Our world is upside down, once more

And it unites us

Life is an embrace

That makes us strong.

Like vapor warming your fingertips

It makes us strong

Like a secret wish.

Without caring about pain and loss

Without pages long

And cultural stereotypes.

With new songs

When the wish is unveiled

Starting from the start

And love becomes a cult

Gaining every single battle

While knowing to return to

a hug.
