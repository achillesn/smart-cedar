__You were born human*___(Lyrics)_

Look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye  
Look me in the eye  
Yes  
In the eye  
Where they say it's the mirror of the soul  
Look deep  
Tell me what do you see?  
Speak and leave every excuse behind  
Tell me  
What do you find?

Look here. Here  
In the guts of the darkness of the iris  
where the universe is condensed  
Where the world is hiding

Stop crying  
Just look  
In there souls of children are floating  
They know the terror  
In there there are souls of mothers that gave birth to them  
and tears of fathers unable to protect them  
In there hyenas and jackals  
Waiting to devour the flesh of everything mortal  
Just waiting.

Fear not. You are safe  
Well hidden in your hole  
Waiting for security to aid  
You pay for it  
So don’t be afraid  
As long as you pay  
you’ll be safe  
Don’t look around  
Don’t look around.

Hide well your despair  
that doesn’t let you breathe air  
every time you are ashamed  
for being alive  
You were born human  
You were born human  
You were born human  
What do you expect?  
You should give the embrace  
you were longing for  
away  
You have nothing but that  
Anyway.

Even your breath  
If you don’t make it live  
when you are alive  
doesn’t belong to you

Even your breath  
If you don’t make it live  
when you are alive,  
doesn’t belong to you

So make a move and  
open the chest of treasure  
you have in your heart  
Take the magic flute  
and start  
to dance to the light  
Deep  
Deep with joy  
and we’ll follow you.  
We’ll follow you.

Look me in the eye  
Look deep  
As if you can see the soul  
Look deep  
And be certain  
That all you see  
Inside  
Is you  
You
