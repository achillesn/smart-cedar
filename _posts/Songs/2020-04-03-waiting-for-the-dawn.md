(Lyrics)

Mine are the dreams  
 Mine are the images  
 That keep strolling like a blind dizziness.  
 The brain is a cell  
 Thoughts without sense tie me well  
 Like a lamb to be slaughtered  
 Waiting for the dawn to come

All that I have  
 All that takes care of me  
 Is now my cell  
 And all I knew is now treading  
 In loneliness  
 Together we were born  
 Together we’ll get lost  
 When we enter infinity  
 In orbit

A blind truth  
 A last breath  
 Is what keeps life  
 Alive.

I never met the essence  
 That simplicity wears  
 I never improved  
 And as long as the stars shine  
 I’m sure I have time

It’s late  
 But it’s never too late.  
 though it’s late  
 It’s late

How far am I from the end?  
 The end of the world  
 Is present every single moment  
 And yet always late.  
 My soul is bleeding  
 Knowledge is slipping away  
 In font of my very eyes  
 Before I turn into pieces  
 In the name of profit.

Mine are the dreams  
 Mine are the images  
 That keep strolling like a blind dizziness.  
 The brain is a cell  
 Thoughts without sense tie me well  
 Like a lamb to be slaughtered  
 Waiting for the dawn to come
