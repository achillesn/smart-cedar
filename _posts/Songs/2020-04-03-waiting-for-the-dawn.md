(Lyrics)

Mine are the dreams  
Mine are the images  
That keep strolling like a blind dizziness.  
The brain is a prison  
Thoughts without sense tie me well  
Like a lamb to be slaughtered  
Waiting for the dawn to come

All that I have  
All that takes care of me  
Is now my cell  
And all I knew is now treading  
In loneliness  
Together we were born  
Together we’ll get lost  
When we enter infinity  
In orbit

A blind truth  
A last breath  
Is what keeps life  
Alive.

I never met the essence  
That simplicity wears  
I never improved  
And as long as the stars shine  
I’m sure I have time

It’s late  
But it’s never too late.  
though it’s late  
It’s late

How far am I from the end?  
The end  
is present every single moment  
and yet always late.  
My soul is bleeding  
Knowledge is slipping away  
in font of my very eyes  
before I turn into pieces  
In the name of profit.

Mine are the dreams  
Mine are the images  
That keep strolling like a blind dizziness.  
The brain is a prison  
Thoughts without sense tie me well  
Like a lamb to be slaughtered  
Waiting for the dawn to come
