(Lyrics)

Nobody knows  
what lies behind dreams.  
Nobody knows

Nobody knows  
what happens when the shadows awake  
and slowly they fold the light  
that gave them birth  
like waves  
playful through thunder  
Like rays  
piercing the core of the cosmos

From light comes shadow  
The same light that nurtures them  
Trying to suck the light  
To acquire life  
Shadows happy  
As they are mournful  
When they devour light  
In darkness  
Something in their nature  
They die

Light, their only hope  
Light their freedom  
The very same light  
Their prison

Shadows that suffer  
As they live  
And they devour the light  
Evaporate  
They stick to dreams  
Like morning dew  
Nesting in silence  
Waiting in patience  
To open your eyes
