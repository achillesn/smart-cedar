Nobody knows  
 What lies behind dreams  
 Nobody knows

Nobody knows  
 What happens when the shadows awake  
 And slowly they fold the light  
 That gave them birth  
 Like waves  
 Playful through thunder  
 Like rays  
 Piercing the core of the cosmos

From light comes shadow  
 The same light that nurtures them  
 Trying to suck the light  
 To acquire life  
 Shadows happy  
 As they are mournful  
 When they devour light  
 In darkness  
 Something in their nature  
 They die

Light, their only hope  
 Light their freedom  
 The very same light  
 Their prison

Shadows that suffer  
 As they live  
 And they devour the light  
 Evaporate  
 They stick to dreams  
 Like morning dew  
 Nesting in silence  
 Waiting in patience  
 To open your eyes
