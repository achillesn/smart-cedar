__Time to get up*__ _(Lyrics)_

Times are changing  
I’m telling you  
Light is coming

You look me in the eye and I’m shy.  
You look around  
Where? You ask  
I show inside  
with a movement as natural as  
patience.  
As oblivion.

You wonder for a while  
Like the grass meeting the wind  
you bend  
and you worship its step  
and continue longing for snow.

I’m wearing the mask of truth  
and I’m begging you to look away  
so you don’t see what is happening for thee  
You should only feel guilty  
to the ancient plot  
that will never appear to you  
unless you lick the mud from her feet.

You breathe deep  
You still breathe  
You don’t know  
In the absolute of ignorance  
breathing slow,  
but still breathing  
Lucky you  
having a breath  
under the ruins  
Like a dried plant  
that continues to exist  
without breath.  
Breathing slow  
Breathing still  
It’s time to get up  
and dance.
