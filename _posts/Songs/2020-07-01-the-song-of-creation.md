__The song of creation*__ _(Lyrics)_

In the beat of boredom  
 the song of creation begins  
 Where nothing fills up with everything  
 while light comes just to reveal.

Through the deep incurable ennui  
 of time that does not cease  
 nothingness and the unstoppable  
 are born

What it was is and will be  
 a creation  
 The last rebellion of simplicity is  
 to decide action.

Action is escape.  
 The route is flooding with the waters of the river  
 and we just wait for them to evaporate  
 to cross to the other side.  
 We get lost  
 It’s about time to build a bridge

Time to feel the pain of kids  
 who innocently tread in paths  
 not walked by us.  
 Nobody has ever walked these steps.

Time is our companion  
 not existing for himself  
 since yesterday today and tomorrow  
 are the same  
 nothing rolls and nothing changes  
 Nothing is born  
 and nothing dies.  
 Everything is now for him.   
 So now it’s time to play hide and seek  
 with our own unbelievable selves   
 waiting for a chance   
 to dance

It’s time to be silent again  
 in a cell of infinite knowledge  
 and to start from scratch  
 once more  
 as if nothing ever happened  
 As if we weren’t here  
 all these years inside the illusion  
 of the beast within  
 that we try to purify.  
 We stroke his ears  
 with advice  
 as if we are gods  
 that share willingly  
 the stars and the sky.
