__The Grace of Loneliness*__ (Lyrics)

In the abyss of the Word  
Joy is hidden  
In a labyrinth stuck  
agonizing to wander back and forth

Bygone and forgotten  
but still deep inside  
waiting for your return  
to the core of style

So many stars in the world  
but only one sky  
So many smiles in our lives  
gone  
Like smoke.

Did you ever suspect, my friend  
how everything would become an image  
even the very human heart

Even Jove  
the god of gods  
feared man  
and tried to stop him  
by splitting him in two  
Donating the eternal torture  
of lack  
the agony of lonesome  
before it transforms to Loneliness

Dancing by yourself  
Getting drunk on your own  
You Die Alone  
and Alone you celebrate

Feeling full Lonely  
and then suffering alone  
with others Alone  
You only forget.

Forget about the gist  
and forget about love  
Wandering around  
alone  
with you.

In its divine apathy  
essence doesn’t care  
just points the way to take  
till you learn to love  
till you learn to love  
till you learn to love  
till you learn to love.
